# Mokka---Flagging-Loans
Mokka Data Science Project

Using the available dataset, build a model that will predict the value of the target variable bad_flag. Prepare a presentation, as a Jupyter notebook, where you will train and test different models, argue for the choice for the best model and show the expected default rate at different approval levels.

This project aims to complete the above task.
